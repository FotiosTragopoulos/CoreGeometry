## Content

### 1. Parallelogram

A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. The opposite sides of a parallelogram are of equal length and the opposite angles are of equal measure.

* Diagonal of a Rectangle
* Diagonal of a Square
* Surface Area of a Parallelogram
* Surface Area of a Rectangle
* Surface Area of a Square
* Perimeter of a Parallelogram
* Perimeter of a Square
* Volume of a Cube

### 2. Triangle

Any three points, when non-collinear, determine a unique triangle and a unique plane. A triangle has three sides and three angles. The three angles always add to 180°.

* Surface Area of a Triangle
* Surface Area - Heron's Formula
* Perimeter of a Triangle

### 3. Circle

A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point. It is the curve traced out by a point that moves so that its distance from a given point is constant.

* Surface Area of a Circle
* Area of a Sector of a Circle
* Curved Surface Area of a Sphere
* Perimeter of a Circle
* Volume of a Sphere

### 4. Polygon

A polygon is a plane 2D shape that is bounded by a finite chain of straight line segments closing in a loop to form a closed chain. These segments are called its sides.

* Surface Area (Apothem - Perimeter)
* Surface Area (Apothem - Number of Sides)
* Surface Area (Radius - Number of Sides)
* Surface Area (Length of a Side - Number of Sides)
* Perimeterof a Canonical Polygon

### 5. Trapezium

A convex quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides is referred to as a trapezoid in American and Canadian English but as a trapezium in English outside North America.

* Surface Area of a Trapezium
* Perimeter of a Trapezium

### 6. Rhombus

A rhombus is a simple quadrilateral whose four sides all have the same length. Another name is equilateral quadrilateral, since equilateral means that all of its sides are equal in length.

* Surface Area (Side - Height)
* Surface Area (Diagonals)
* Surface Area (Angle)
* Perimeter of Rhombus

### 7. Cone

A cone is a three-dimensional geometric shape that tapers smoothly from a flat base (frequently, though not necessarily, circular) to a point called the apex or vertex.

* Slant Height of a Cone
* Total Surface Area (Radius - Height)
* Total Surface Area (Radius - Slant Height)
* Curved Surface Area (Radius - Slant Height)
* Curved Surface Area (Radius - Height)
* Volume of a Cone

### 8. Cylinder

A cylinder is one of the most basic curvilinear geometric shapes whose surface is formed by the points at a fixed distance from a given straight line, the axis of the cylinder.

* Curved Surface Area of a Cylinder
* Total Surface Area of a Cylinder
* Volume of a Cylinder

### 9. Ellipse

An ellipse is a curve on a plane that surrounds two focal points such that the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant for every point on the curve.

* Surface Area of Ellipse
* Perimeter of Ellipse
* Volume of Ellipsoid

### 10. Analytical Geometry

Analytic geometry is the study of geometry using a coordinate system. It is frequently used in physics and engineering, and is the foundation of most modern fields of geometry.

* Distance Between 2 points (x,y)
* Distance Between 2 points (x,y,z)
* Slope of a Line
